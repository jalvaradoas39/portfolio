			"bio": "In 2004, I joined the military. Upon completion in 2008 with honorable discharge, I re-entered the civilian world and enrolled into college as a pre-med student. Into my third year, I was enthusiastic of the direction technology was heading and wanted to play a huge part in it, so I decided to drop out of school and teach myself to program. My new journey began with learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the front-end then shortly afterwards extending my reach into the back-end with PHP and MySQL. Since then my toolset and programming skills has continued to grow. I thrive in challenging environments and hate to be the smartest person in a room. This is why I'm excited to make a huge impact at a high growth company.",
